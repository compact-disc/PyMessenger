# PyMessenger

Python command line messenger with a server and client. Created and tested in Ubuntu Linux.

### Complete:
- Multiple clients (Multithreading)
- Usernames on clients with argument parsing on the client side
- Added more print messages to server side with useful information about who is sending each message
- Added >> to client for distinguishing between send/receive
- Comments on the code
- Added the ability to just reuse the port if server crashes, close with Control-C (no more "port taken" issue)
- Add MySQL database to store message id, username, and message
- Echo messages to all clients after sending
